This project provides a free [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) based Raspberry Pi image with [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) and [Homebridge Config UI X](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-config-ui-x) pre-installed.

* Runs on RPI 2 or higher models supporting ARMv7 cpu's or greater ( Last version supporting RPI 1 and RPi Zero W was [v1.2.4](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-raspbian-image/releases/tag/v1.2.4))
* Built on Raspbian Lite (no desktop)
* Simple WiFi Setup
* Includes [ffmpeg](https://github.com/homebridge/ffmpeg-for-homebridge) pre-compiled with audio support (libfdk-aac)
* Includes a user friendly, easy to use web based GUI to configure Homebridge and monitor your Raspberry Pi
* Visual configuration for over 400 plugins (no manual config.json editing required)

This image also provides a command called `hb-config` which helps you keep Node.js up-to-date, perform maintenance on your Homebridge server, and install additional optional software such as *[Pi Hole](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-raspbian-image/wiki/How-To-Install-Pi-Hole)* and *[deCONZ](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge-raspbian-image/wiki/How-To-Install-deCONZ-for-ConBee-or-RaspBee)*.

The Homebridge service is installed using the method described in the official [Raspberry Pi Installation Guide](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge/wiki/Install-Homebridge-on-Raspbian) on the [Homebridge](https://github.com/homebridge/homebridge) project wiki.
